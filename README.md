# Workout Utils

A collection of tools for extracting exercise data and muscle information from the Muscle and Motion Strength app, along with an interactive muscle anatomy visualizer.

## Interactive Muscle Visualizer

The muscle-map application is a modern React-based interactive anatomy viewer that shows which muscles are targeted, synergist, stabilizer, or lengthening during different exercises. It dynamically loads exercise data from CSV files containing 940+ exercises from the Muscle and Motion database.

### Running the Muscle Map

#### Quick Start
```bash
cd muscle-map
bun run dev
```
This will:
- Start the Vite development server with Bun
- Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`

#### Production Build
```bash
cd muscle-map
bun run build
bun run preview
```

#### Configuration Setup
Before running, ensure the configuration is generated from CSV data:
```bash
uv run generate_config.py
```
This creates `muscle-map/public/config_generated.json` from the exercise and muscle CSV files.

### Data Pipeline

1. **Source Data**:
   - `muscle_and_motion_exercises_full.csv` - Contains all exercise definitions
   - `muscles_mapped.csv` - Maps muscle names to visualization groups

2. **Config Generation** (`generate_config.py`):
   - Reads exercise data from CSV
   - Creates muscle name to SVG ID mappings
   - Outputs `muscle-map/public/config_generated.json` for the React application

3. **Visualization** (`muscle-map/`):
   - Modern React application with TypeScript
   - Loads generated config via fetch API
   - Dynamic exercise selection with type-safe components
   - Real-time muscle highlighting in dual front/back anatomy views

## Muscle and Motion Scraper Setup

### 1. Configure Login Credentials (Optional)

For automatic login, create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your Muscle and Motion email and password:

```
MUSCLE_MOTION_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
MUSCLE_MOTION_PASSWORD=your_password
```

If you don't provide credentials, the script will open a browser window and wait for you to log in manually.

### 2. Install Playwright browsers

Before running the script, you need to install the Chromium browser for Playwright:

```bash
uv run --with playwright python -m playwright install chromium
```

## Muscle and Motion Scraper Usage

This script can be run as a standalone uv script. First, make sure you have [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed.

### Exercise Scraping (Two-Step Process)

**Step 1: Collect all exercise links** (fast operation):
```bash
uv run scrape_muscle_and_motion_v2.py links
```

**Step 2: Extract detailed information** from collected links:
```bash
uv run scrape_muscle_and_motion_v2.py details
```

**Run both steps at once**:
```bash
uv run scrape_muscle_and_motion_v2.py
```

### Muscle Collection

**Collect muscles and their groups**:
```bash
uv run scrape_muscle_and_motion_v2.py muscles
```

This command will:
- Navigate to the A-Z page and click the "Muscular Anatomy" filter
- Collect all muscle names and URLs
- For muscles with parentheses (e.g., "Buccinator (10)"), extract muscle group information using URL pattern matching
- Export results to CSV files

### Configuration

Edit the `MAX_EXERCISES` variable in `scrape_muscle_and_motion_v2.py` to control batch size:

- `MAX_EXERCISES = None` - Process all remaining exercises (can take several hours)
- `MAX_EXERCISES = 50` - Process next 50 exercises (recommended for batch processing)
- `MAX_EXERCISES = 10` - Process next 10 exercises (useful for testing)

The script will:
- Automatically log in if credentials are provided in `.env` (runs headless)
- Open a browser window for manual login if no credentials are set

**Operation modes:**
1. **Links mode**: Navigate to A-Z page with Exercises filter, collect all exercise titles and paths, save to `exercise_links.csv`
2. **Details mode**: Process each exercise path, extract muscles/equipment/descriptions, save to `muscle_and_motion_exercises_full.csv`
3. **Muscles mode**: Navigate to A-Z page with Muscular Anatomy filter, collect muscle names and groups, save to muscle CSV files

## Output Files

The scraper creates multiple CSV files:

### Exercise Files

#### `exercise_links.csv` (from links command)
- `title`: Exercise name
- `exercise_path`: Relative path to exercise page

#### `muscle_and_motion_exercises_full.csv` (from details command)
- `title`: Exercise name
- `exercise_path`: Relative path to exercise page  
- `url`: Full URL to the exercise page
- `target_muscles`: Primary muscles targeted
- `synergist_muscles`: Supporting muscles involved
- `stabilizer_muscles`: Stabilizing muscles used
- `description`: Complete exercise instructions
- `equipment`: Inferred equipment needed (Barbell, Dumbbell, etc.)

### Muscle Files

#### `muscle_links.csv` (from muscles command)
- `muscle`: Muscle name
- `url`: Full URL to the muscle page

#### `muscles_full.csv` (from muscles command)
- `muscle`: Muscle name (e.g., "Buccinator (10)")
- `url`: Full URL to the muscle page
- `muscle_group`: Muscle group extracted from individual muscle pages (e.g., "Muscles of Facial Expression")

#### `muscles_final.csv` (muscle mapping file)
- `muscle`: Muscle name
- `url`: Full URL to the muscle page
- `muscle_group`: Original muscle group from scraping
- `svg_muscle_group`: Mapped to specific SVG muscle groups for visualization (36 options)

This file provides a comprehensive mapping from the original scraped muscle list to standardized anatomical classifications suitable for fitness applications and muscle visualization.

## Notes

### Exercise Collection
- The browser runs headless if credentials are provided, otherwise opens for manual login
- Link collection: Automatically scrolls through A-Z page to load all 1,160+ exercises
- Detail extraction: Processes each exercise page to extract comprehensive information
- **Resume capability**: If the details extraction is interrupted, simply run the command again and it will automatically resume from where it left off
- Equipment inference: Based on keywords in title and description
- Non-standard CSS classes (jss*) are avoided for reliable extraction

### Muscle Collection
- Uses the "Muscular Anatomy" filter on the A-Z page
- Automatically detects muscles with parentheses (e.g., "Buccinator (10)") 
- For parentheses muscles: extracts muscle group using URL pattern matching (e.g., URL ending in `.10` maps to parent group URL)
- For muscles without parentheses: no additional processing required
- Muscle group examples: "Muscles of Facial Expression", "Sole of Foot (1st Plantar Layer)", "Wrist Flexors", etc.

## Resume Feature

The details extraction supports automatic resume:
- If `muscle_and_motion_exercises_full.csv` exists, the script will read it and skip already processed exercises
- Progress is saved after each exercise, so you can safely interrupt with Ctrl+C
- To start fresh, delete the CSV file before running
- Perfect for handling network interruptions or processing in batches

### Batch Processing Strategy

Due to potential network timeouts and server rate limiting, it's recommended to process exercises in batches:

1. Set `MAX_EXERCISES = 50` in the script
2. Run `uv run scrape_muscle_and_motion_v2.py details`
3. Wait for completion (approximately 2-3 minutes per exercise)
4. Repeat until all exercises are processed

The script will show progress like:
```
>>> Resuming: 337 exercises already processed
>>> 823 exercises remaining to process
>>> Processing first 50 exercises for testing
[338/387] Processing: Hip Abductor Stretch
[339/387] Processing: Hip Adduction (Cable)
...
```

### Monitoring Progress

The script includes comprehensive logging to both console and file:

**To run and monitor in real-time:**
1. **Start the scraper**: `uv run scrape_muscle_and_motion_v2.py details`
2. **In a new terminal window**: `tail -f scraper.log`

**Log format:**
```
2025-08-25 19:30:45 | INFO | [789/1160] Processing: Hip Thrust (Barbell)
2025-08-25 19:30:48 | INFO | [789] âœ“ Completed: Hip Thrust (Barbell) (muscles: 3)
2025-08-25 19:30:50 | ERROR | [790] ERROR processing Invalid Exercise: timeout
```

**Log file locations:**
- `scraper.log` - Complete log with timestamps
- Console output - Real-time progress display

### Performance Notes

- Each exercise takes approximately 2-3 seconds under ideal conditions
- Network timeouts may occur and are handled gracefully
- Processing all 1,160 exercises can take 1-3 hours depending on connection
- The script continues processing even after individual exercise failures
- All progress is logged with detailed timestamps for debugging
