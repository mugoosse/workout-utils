Push yourself up and stand on the box. Then, go back down in a cross while keeping the same foot on the box. Think about keeping your hips square throughout the exercise and your chest facing forward. The Gluteus Maximus and Gluteus Medius musculature extensively contribute to weight-bearing movements by supplying local structural stability to the hip joint and maintaining lower extremity alignment of the hip and knee joints. Performance deficiency in these selected hip muscles is linked to lower extremity pathology. 1. Simenz, C. J., Garceau, L. R., Lutsch, B. N., Suchomel, T. J., & Ebben, W. P. (2012).
